KPI: incremental revenue lift via holdout tests.\n3) Dynamic recommendations: “frequently bought together” and session-based “you might like”. KPI: attach rate, recommendation CTR, AOV.\n4) Fraud screening at checkout: supervised model + rules for edge cases. KPI: chargeback rate, false positive rate.\n5) Support deflection: retrieval‑augmented chatbot for policies, order tracking, returns.
